### Strategy
My objective in the design was to build a fully responsive site that provides easily accessible information to prospective employers with a visually appealing format.

### Scope
For employers, my goal was to provide a brief overview of myself as a Full-stack Web Developer. This includes a brief introduction about me, my projects, my skillset, my CV, with many options for contacting me.

### Structure
In the Home section, I wanted employers to know my name and job title. In the about section, I wanted to briefly introduce my self. In the Portfolio section, I wanted them to see the projects I have done and the technologies used. In the Skills section, I wanted them to have an overview of my skill set. In the contact section, I wanted to provide many options for contacting me. And lastly, on my CV I wanted to provide them with my educational background and work experience.

### Features Left To Implement
I the nearest future, I will complete the projects that are currently in the planning stage. I would like to add features to the contact form that will enable me to receive emails via the contact form.
